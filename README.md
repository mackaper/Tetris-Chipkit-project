# Tetris on a ChipKit

This repository contains a hardware-driven implementation of Tetris developed as part of the **IS1500 Computer Organization and Components** course. The project demonstrates embedded systems programming using a ChipKit microcontroller.

## Key Features

- **Game Mechanics:** Includes piece generation, rotation, line clearing, and score tracking.
- **Hardware Integration:** Outputs to an LED matrix or display and supports button controls for gameplay.
- **Optimized Design:** Efficient use of memory and processing power for real-time performance.

## Highlights

- **Low-Level Programming:** Written in C with efficient use of GPIO pins and timer interrupts.
- **Embedded Systems:** Hands-on experience with microcontroller programming and hardware interfacing.
